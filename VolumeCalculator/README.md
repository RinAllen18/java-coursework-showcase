# Assignment 7 - Volume Calculator

### Purpose
This program allows a user to compute the volume of 4 different shape types (cube, sphere, cylinder, and rectangular). 
The user can continually calculate shape volumes until otherwise specified with a sentinel. The program utilizes four 
separate methods in the same class that return volumes for their shape type calculations, and one method to handle 
invalid input from the user regarding the shape type selected.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Modulular rogramming and method design
- Control flow and decision structures
- User input validation and interation
- Mathmatical computation
- Constants, variables, and scope
- Output formatting and presentation

##Example Output

Option   Shape
-------------------
 1       Cube
 2       Sphere
 3       Cylinder
 4       Rectangular Prism
 5       Exit

Select a shape to calculate its volume. Select option 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 to exit: 2
Enter the radius: 3
Sphere volume = 113.10

Option   Shape
-------------------
