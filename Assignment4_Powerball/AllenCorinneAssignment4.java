/*
 * Name: Corinne Allen
 * Class: CS1150 (M/W)
 * Due: Sept 24, 2025
 * Description: Assignment #4
 * This program allows a user to participate in a Powerball as a player. 
 * The program prompts the player to choose two letters and one number; this 
 * will create their selection ticket. The program then generates its own ticket 
 * with a random assortment of 2 letters and one number. To determine if the 
 * player won the Powerball lottery the program compares the userâ€™s ticket to  
 * the randomly generated ticket.
