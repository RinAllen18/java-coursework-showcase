# Challenge - Elevator Simulation

## Purpose
This project simulates an elevator system that handles one user and one simulated external floor request per iteration. 
The elevator also has the ability to shutdown given a special key.

## Features
- Main user selects destination floor.
- Simulated secondary user requests to the elevator.
- Elevator picks up secondary passenger on the way and prioritizes main user's floor selection.
- Elevator shutdown mode for maintenance.

## Skills Demonstrated
-Modular programming
- Looping and iteration control
- User input and validation
- Randomization and dynamic simulation
- Output formatting and simulation feedback
- Sentinel-controlled program termination

## Assumptions
- Building has 14 floors (1‚Äì14).
- One elevator.
- User input is expected to be valid integers.
- user knows that special code for shut down is inserting the key, and that the key is -1.

## Optional Enhancements
- Allow for simulated internal requests.
- Allow for multiple external requests during elevator movement.
- Simulate time passing while the elevator is moving.
- Graphical user interface.

## Example Output:
```
