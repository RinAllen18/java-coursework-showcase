# Assignment 5 - Coffee Shop Accounting

### Purpose
This program that allows a coffee shop owner to input multiple sale amounts that each of his stores 
accomplished. The program will read the input individually and test each amount against a sentinel value
The loop will determine and display how many sales were in each monetary amount range; determine and 
display the smallest and largest sale in the sequence; display a bar chart that represents how large the
sales were for each store (in increments of $100); determine and display the total count of sales, the 
sum of sales, and the average of all sales.

## Skills Demonstrated
Looping and control structures
Data aggregation and statistical computation
Sentinel-controlled input
User interation and console visualization
Real-world application

##Example Output
```
Enter sales from all coffee shops, end input by entering -1: 250 900 2500 650 700 105 -1

Sale #1: **
Sale #2: *********
Sale #3: *************************
Sale #4: ******
Sale #5: *******
Sale #6: *

Number of sales            = 6
Smallest sale amount       = 105.0
Largest sale amount        = 2500.0
Total of all sales amount  = 5105.0
Average                    = 850.83

Number of sale amounts less than $500         = 2
Number of sale amounts between $500 and $2000 = 3
Number of sale amounts more than $2000        = 1
